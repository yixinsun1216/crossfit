Description: An implementation of double/debiased machine learning method 
        (Chernozhukov et al.2018)to remove regularization bias and 
        overfitting in estimating parameters of interest.This method has two 
        critical contributions: 
        1. The use of cross-fitting to efficiently split the sample. 
        2. Identifying parameters using Neyman-orthogonal moments, which are 
        less sensitive to errors in estimating nuisance parameters. 
        Here, we introduce select machine learning techniques that 
        can be applied for causal inference in this framework.
