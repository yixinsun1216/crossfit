This package implements the Double Machine Learning approach from (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), which constructs estimates for low-dimensional target parameters in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters. The methods and calculations are detailed in [this file](https://github.com/yixinsun1216/crossfit/blob/master/notes/dml_methods.pdf).
